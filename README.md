# Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics
No conflict detected (02/09/2020).
## A new fully functional department with 66 diagnoses including 56 clinical and 10 trauma!
I recommend having an sonography unit to find the diagnoses.
I recommend having an ICU to treat any complications.

### Description:
This mod allows the introduction of a new female only department. This adds many elements such as new diagnoses, symptoms, examinations or treatments but also decorative elements ( to come after update 2.0 ).
The symptomatology and therapy is based on the recommendations of the CNGOF (National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians) and the HAS (High Authority for Health from France).


# This mod needs CRP to work.
